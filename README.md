2 TSP approximations: 
1. The double neighbor heuristic (as described by my AP CS prof)
2. Christophides using the guide made by the lovely people at https://cse442-17f.github.io/Traveling-Salesman-Algorithms/
  a. includes Prim's algo, Minimum cost perfect matching, Fleury's Algo, Eulerian Circuits, Hamiltonian Circuits
